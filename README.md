## Motivation:
---
 #### I created this game because I believed it would be an easy tool to use to be able to quiz yourself on front-end questions. It allows the user to be able to enjoy a game and be able to practice front-end fundamentals through the quiz. In the future I can implement a create your own quiz where the user can input their own questions and answers for their own studying use.
